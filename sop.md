# SOP Advice

## Avoid this. 

- damaging personal statements
    - discussion of mental health problem
        - "highlight how they were drawn to graduate study because of significant personal problems"
    - excessively altruistic professional goals
        - eg. "I want to help people"
        - focus on professional activities (eg. research interests, academic strengths) rather than purely personal characteristics
    - don't overshare personal information
        - if you include anything personal at all (eg. personal struggles), keep it short
    - professionally inappropriate
        - common sense stuff. avoid controversial topics, inappropriate humour, religion, etc. 
- harmful LORs
    - undesirable applicant characteristics
        - good: intelligent, motivated, responsible, agreeable, ability to work independently, can persevere
        - bad: arrogant, self-centered, unreliable, immature, imposing, needs direction
        - being competent is not good enough. letter should include superlatives. 
    - inappropriate sources 
        - letters should be from professors or people who have been involved in educational or research activities. 
        - should be able to describe work habits and potential as a grad student. 
- lack of info about program
    - do: background reading on faculty and their publications, how your research interests align with theirs. demonstrate understanding of focus of the program. 
    - show that you understand (concrete examples, not just saying the program is perfect for you) why the program is a good fit. what do they offer that you want?
- misfired attempts to impress
    - don't: be critical of your undergrad program. blame others for your poor academic record. eg. i didn't learn anything at x, so i'm applying to this program where i will actually learning something", "professors here at x were unwilling to help me succeed"
    - don't: namedrop without evidence of having a real connection. getting politicians to write lors. 



## Things to Write About
- demonstrate area of your academic or research interest. what about it excites you?
- how your past education and other experience have prepped you to be successful in this program
    - what skills do you bring? be specific. 
- what you hope to achieve
- why this particular program is the best place for you to pursue your interests
- what work you have already done in this area
    - specific skills that you have learned that are relevant 
- mention specific faculty members or projects and how they align with your specific area of interest
- mention any publications and conferences you have been a part of 
- demonstrate that you have a clear understanding of what the program involves. affirm that you are interested in what it offers. 
- who are you? what do you want to do? distinguish yourself from other people in the field. do not be vague. 
- "use specific examples of past work to explain why you are capable of achieving the goals you are setting for yourself for the future"
- be careful with this one: extenuating circumstances. DO NOT COMPLAIN. what did you do despite these circumstances? what positives came of it or despite it? how did you work through this?
- don't: write about being a child genius or what you were doing as a kid. 


## Things to Do

- homework. 
    - research the department and program. highlight appealing parts. 
    - read publications from faculty of interest. 
- reflect/understand. 
    - major moments in your life leading you to current research interests. 
    - role models? what qualities were appealing. 
    - why did you choose this area of research? why this field in general? why your undergrad major? why this program?
    - what do you hope to accomplish? where do you see yourself in x years?
- answer.
    - why this program? what aspects of it area appealing?
    - what are your research interests? how did you become interested in it?
    - what have you done to prepare to answer the issues in this research area? eg. research experiences, courses, etc.
    - what are your future goals? how can this program help you accomplish those goals? 
    - what do you bring to the program?

## General Writing Tips
- write out the full thing the first time before using it as an acronym. (eg. university of toronto (u of t)... u of t...)
- use positive language when referring to yourself. 
- demonstrate using examples. show don't tell. 
- make sure everything is linked somehow. continuity in writing and in themes. 
- be concise. give details, but cut the irrelevant stuff. 
- have strong opening and closing. 
- thank them for their time. 
- revision: read your draft out loud. get others to read it. ask for feedback. 
- better to use small words and be clear than to use big words that you don't understand fully or to try to sound smart
- avoid qualifiers (eg. basically, essentially, mostly, etc.)
- use active voice instead of passive voice. 
- positive over negative phrasing. ie. try to avoid the word "not" where possible. (eg. if it is raining, we will cancel vs unless it is raining, we will not cancel; dishonest vs not honest; i rarely get sick vs i do not get sick very often)
